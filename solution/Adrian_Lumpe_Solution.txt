== Solution 2.1

The wallet from file contracts/Wallet.sol is vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack. In the withdraw() function the current balance is sent to the sender (line 33) before setting the balance to 0 (line 35). This enables a malicious sender to recursively call the withdraw() function from within the fallback() function of the sending contract to withdraw more than originally deposited. In our implementation we withdraw 5 times the amount we deposited using an internal counter to limit the recursion.
